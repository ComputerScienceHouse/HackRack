Documentation for CSH's Airgap lab.

## Overview

#### Hardware
- [ ] What will we be working with here?
- [ ] Remove or block RJ45 jacks in that room
- [ ] Locked and closed rack

#### Software
- [ ] virt vs baremetal?
- [ ] Golden image on a container or proxmox level?
- [ ] What applications do we want?

## Security Considerations

#### Vectors (ranked by priority high to low):
- [ ] Ethernet
- [ ] USB
- [ ] WiFi
- [ ] Bluetooth
- [ ] Other physical interfaces
- [ ] Extraneous RF Emissions

#### User Experience
- [ ] We can't do SSO or standard homedirs, this should probably just be one username and password
- [ ] What access to proxmox do users get?
